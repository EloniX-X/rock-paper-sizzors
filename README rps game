i had first done my rps game semi commented and now with the gui version i did comment on it.

both of the games have the same idea exept one of them is done in tkinter.

for the gui version i did have a very different code but it still has the same idea

if you are trying to use this code as an example use the non gui version becuase it is easier to model off of

alot of the code was taken from youtube tutorials but i did code most of it.

this has been Eloni and remember to use face masks or i will not your kneecaps off
